# Bouesso-service
In this project, I would like to present a new method on how I can use json data at the frontend level regardless of its origin. For our case, we have created a folder containing data that we will use throughout the project, going from navbar to footer through the different sections of our project.

## Types of technologies used
Among the technologies we had to use, we have:
`react-dom`: is a React library specifically dedicated to manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model) in React applications;
`react-router-dom`: is a React library that makes it easy to navigate and manage routes in a React web application. It is based on the react-router-core library and offers a React-specific interface for managing routes;
`react-slick`: is a React library specially designed for creating responsive and customizable carousels (sliders) in React web applications. This library uses slick-carousel underneath and offers a React interface to easily integrate carousels into your projects;
`web-vitals`: is an open-source library that allows you to measure essential performance indicators to evaluate the user experience on the web. These indicators, called "Web Vitals", are user-centric metrics that evaluate the loading speed, responsiveness and visual stability of web pages. These metrics are crucial to ensuring an optimal user experience.
